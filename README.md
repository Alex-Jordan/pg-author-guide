# PG Author Guide

Maybe this guide will be automatically built and accessible from a WeBWorK installation one day.


For now, to build it:
1. Install the PreTeXt CLI: <https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-cli>
2. Clone this repository and change directory into the `PG-guide` folder.
3. `pretext generate webwork`
4. `pretext build web`
5. `pretext view web`
